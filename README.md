# Just a few words
Gungutils... get it? 'cause I'm Gungu, and these are my utils. Anyways, the TODO list might seem long, that's because it is. I know very well that I'm not even close to making a game in this, but I'm commited. I worked a lot on it so far, and I don't plan on stopping. When development is over I'll surely make a documentation, I'm sure... =D
